<h1>Fast Jsx Pizza</h1>

https://fast-jsx-pizza.netlify.app/

A React project demonstrating JSX `components` and `props` by building a dynamic pizza ordering interface.

## 👍 My Challenges:

- Tailwind CSS has been applied.
- Separated components were created.
- "Add to Favorites" button added.
- Pop-up modal window implemented.
- And efforts were made to provide a good user experience 🙂
